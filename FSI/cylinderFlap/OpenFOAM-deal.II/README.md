# Tutorial for an FSI simulation of a cylinder-flap scenario

This tutorial case uses a real 2D mesh in deal.II for the simulation, which is much more efficient. However, the case setup is still the same as in the quasi 2D case, which is already [described in its README file](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/blob/master/FSI/cylinderFlap/OpenFOAM-deal.II/README.md).
